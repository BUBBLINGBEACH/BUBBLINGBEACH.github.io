                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you're new, hello there !! I am BEACH, as you may have guessed.<br>
                    I've formed a hobby of making colorful character illustrations on MAGMA as of late, and figured it might be worth making some snack money out of it.<br>
                    Regardless, if you're here, you've probably seen at least a bit of my work.<br>
                    I'll still have some sitting around because I can.<br>
                    <br>
                    Anyway yeah commissions.<br>
                    How about emI currently do all my work on a MAC TRACKPAD with a 6px PIXEL PENCIL, which I am sure is not particularly conducive to most healthy artistic practices but it makes drawing condensed shapes a lot easier.<br>
                    I very rarely do SKETCHES or LINEART as a result—any sketches I do are pretty chunky and reserved for bigger pieces, so I usually just skip straight to FLAT COLOR.<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>My prices</h2>
                <p>Prices may vary*</p>
                <div class="prices flex-wrap">

                            ~20 min to 1 hr of time each)

                        <h2>FLAT COLOR</h2> <p> <span class="green"> 4 USD / 400 RBX</p>

                            And other small doodles that fall into this general size range. They don't have to be profile pictures!
                            I can put up to 6 icons on one CANVAS too, if you want. Extra icons cost 75% of the base price ($3 flat, $4.50 shaded) each.

                            And other stuff in this general size range, too. If you're not sure what size CANVAS you'd prefer, do ask! I'd be happy to help you figure it out.I have no limit on character quantity per piece—just keep in mind it might get cramped if you add too many.

                            DOODLE PAGES are just several smaller pieces of one or two characters on one CANVAS. They're mostly just for me to mess around with little scenarios, but if you'd want one—go right ahead! Whether you have ideas for each doodle or not.

                            Do give me some feedback if you notice something off or want something changed! No one wants to end up with a messed-up final product, myself included.
